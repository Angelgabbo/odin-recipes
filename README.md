# odin-recipes

This is my first project, I tried to use everything I found useful. Thinking about it, i could have used more links (like one to take you back to the top of the pages, or ones to bring you to specific sections). the inde page is rather poor, could have used an image there to fill.

The project consist of a recipe website, with an index page and three recipe pages. The purpose was to put in use my knowledge of the basic tags  and elements, such as headings, images, paragraphs and links.
